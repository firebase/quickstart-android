After running the app you should see a screen like this:

<img src="app/src/screen.png" height="534" width="300"/>

The first time you run the app you will be asked what your
favorite food is. This choice will be logged to Firebase
Analytics as a [User Property][user-props].

As you swipe between tabs in the app, `SELECT_CONTENT` events 
are logged to Analytics. You can see these events in
real time using [Debug View][debug-view].

/**
 * A wrapper around a [Logger] that provides a bit of functionality used commonly by the
 * Firebase Data Connect Gradle plugin and its classes.
 *
 * Each logged message will be prefixed with a randomly-generated alphanumeric prefix,
 * making it easy to track the output of a logger throughout the sea of log messages in
 * Gradle's output.
 *
 * @param loggerIdPrefix A string with which to prefix the randomly-generated logger ID
 * included in each message logged by this object. This is typically a very short (between
 * 2 and 4 characters) string whose prefix will give some indication of where the logged
 * messages came from. A common strategy is to use the uppercase characters of a class name;
 * for example a class named "DataFileLoader" could use the `loggerIdPrefix` of "dfl".
 * @param logger The logger that will be used to do the actual logging.

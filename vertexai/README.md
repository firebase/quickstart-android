# [DEPRECATED] Firebase Vertex AI Sample for Android (Kotlin)

> [!CAUTION] 
> On May 20, 2025, we released the Firebase AI SDK (`firebase-ai`). This SDK replaces the previous Vertex AI in Firebase SDK (`firebase-vertexai`) to accommodate the evolving set of supported features and services.
> * The new Firebase AI SDK provides Preview support for the Gemini Developer API, including its free tier offering.
> * Using the Firebase AI SDK with the Vertex AI Gemini API is still generally available (GA).
>
> If you're using the old `firebase-vertexai`, we recommend [migrating to firebase-ai](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ai-logic/migrate-to-latest-sdk) because all new development and features will be in this new SDK.
>
> The quickstart sample app for `firebase-ai` can be found in the [/firebase-ai directory](../firebase-ai/).

Firebase Remote Config Quickstart
==============================

The Firebase Remote Config Android quickstart app demonstrates using Remote
Config to define user-facing text in an Android app.

Introduction
------------

This is a simple example of using Remote Config to override in-app default
values by defining service-side parameter values in the Firebase console. This
example demonstrates a small subset of the capilities of Firebase Remote
Config. To learn more about how you can use Firebase Remote Config in your app,
see
[Firebase Remote Config Introduction](https://firebase.google.com/docs/remote-config/).

Getting started
---------------

1. [Add Firebase to your Android Project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup).
2. [Create a Remote Config project for the quickstart sample](https://firebase.google.com/docs/remote-config/android#create_a_product_name_project_for_the_quickstart_sample),
  defining the parameter values and parameter keys used by the sample.
3. Run the sample on an Android device or emulator.
4. Change one or more parameter values in the Firebase Console (the value of
  `welcome_message`, `welcome_message_caps`, or both).
5. Tap **Fetch Remote Config** in the app to fetch new parameter values and see
  the resulting change in the app.

Best practices
--------------
This section provides some additional information about how the quickstart
example sets in-app default parameter values and fetches values from the Remote
Config service

### In-app default parameter values ###

In-app default values are set using an XML file in this example, but you can
also set in-app default values inline using other `setDefault` methods of the
[`FirebaseRemoteConfig` class](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/android/com/google/firebase/remoteconfig/FirebaseRemoteConfig#public-method-summary).
Then, you can override only those values that you need to change from the
Firebase console. This lets you use Remote Config for any default value that you
might want to override in the future, without the need to set all of those
values in the Firebase console.

### Fetch values from the Remote Config service ###

When an app calls `fetch`, cached parameter values are used unless the last
successful fetch occurred 12 hours ago, or unless a value less than 43200 (the
number of seconds in 12 hours) is specified for `cacheExpirationSeconds`. If a
cached value is not used, updated parameter values are fetched from the Remote
Config service.

Fetched values are cached locally, but not immediately activated. To activate
fetched values so that they take effect, call the `activateFetched` method. In
the quickstart sample app, you call this method from the UI by tapping
**Fetch Remote Config**.

You can also create a Remote Config Setting to enable developer mode, but you
must remove this setting before distributing your app. Fetching Remote Config
data from the service is normally limited to a few requests per hour. By
enabling developer mode, you can make many more requests per hour, so you can
test your app with different Remote Config parameter values during development.

  Frequently Asked Question (FAQ) on
  [fetching and activating parameter values](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#remote-config-values).
- To learn about parameters and conditions that you can use to change the
  behavior and appearance of your app for segments of your userbase, see
  [Remote Config Parameters and Conditions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/remote-config/parameters).
